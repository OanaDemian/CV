## Oana Demian
Passionate and empathetic Software Engineer, recent graduate of the intensive Makers Academy Bootcamp with a background in Applied Behaviour Analysis and Special Needs Education. In my former profession as a Board Certified Behaviour Analyst, I saw technology breaking boundaries and changing people's lives. I would like to be part of a team that creates products aimed at improving our lives and I think technology is a way to do this at a grand scale.

## Skills

#### Communication
- As a BCBA, working with a range of key stakeholders was an important skill. 
- An Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy programme is a joint effort - treatment plan goals are implemented by behaviour technicians, teaching assistants and parents, overseen by a BCBA and and generalised by a variety of other people including classroom teachers, Occupational Therapist, Speech and and Language Therapists, grandparents and nannies. 
- With proper buy in, the other persons involved in the child's education could help me to implement and generalise the treatment plan and without buy in they could jeopardise the intervention plan. Building a strong collaborative relationship with parents and other professionals required interpersonal skills, such as good communication and interpersonal skills, alongside technical skills.

#### Working in a team
- I enjoy working closely with people to build something better together. I used to have a caseload of 10-12 students, each with a team of two to three behaviour technicians who were implementing the treatment plans I designed. I was responsible for providing support, technical training and clearly documented comprehensive treatment plans. 

#### Analysing behaviour
- In my previous career as a Board Certified Behaviour Analyst (BCBA) I used task analysis to break complex tasks into a sequence of smaller, more manageable and achievable steps or actions.  
- For some children with learning disorders such as autism, even simple tasks presented complex challenges. Understanding the steps involved in a particular task, their order and the difficulties they posed for the learner was important in determining how the skills would be taught. It also assisted in identifying any steps that needed extra instruction and could be taught outside of the chain. 
- This is similar to approaching programming and automation challenges where each step needs to be carefully scripted.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2022 to March 2023)
- At Makers, I had the opportunity to work in an agile team with daily morning standups, refinement sessions to design features and carefully plan our MVP.  
- We utilised TDD, pair-programming practices, sprints, CI/CD, Git workflow and GitHub actions for automated testing. 
- We had retros at the end of each sprint to reflect on the past sprint.
